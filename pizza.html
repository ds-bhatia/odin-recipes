    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy and quick homemade pizza recipe from scratch. The base dough requires just 30 minutes for kneading and rising, making this a very achievable dinner or lunch idea.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of plain flour</li>
        <l1>2 tablespoons and 1/4 teaspoon one sachet of instant or active dry yeast</l1>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients and gently knead with fingertips until a slightly sticky dough forms. You don't need to knead too much, just until the dough forms. In the Kitchenaid, it took me about 3 mins.</li>
        <li>Place in an oiled bowl and turn the dough so the oil coats it. </li>
        <li>Cover with a damp kitchen towel and let it rise for about 20-25 mins or until doubled in volume</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and knead lightly until it forms a ball</li>
    </ol>
